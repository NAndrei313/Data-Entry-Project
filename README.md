Automated Price Comparison for Competing Denim Brands

This Python-based project automates the comparison of prices for a specific category of products from two competitor denim brands, listed on a European retailer's website.
The program collects data directly from the website using Python web scraping techniques and stores it in Google Forms for structured data organization. 
The data is then exported to Google Sheets, where detailed comparisons are performed.

Key Highlights:

Python-driven web scraping for automated data collection. 
Seamless integration with Google Forms for storing scraped data. 
Data export to Google Sheets for streamlined comparison and analysis
